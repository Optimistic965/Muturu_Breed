                    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cattle are the most important livestock species that supply meat with contributions from poultry, sheep and goats and other forms of livestock including bush meat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The indigenous Muturu cattle (MC) found almost in all the geopolitical zones in Nigeria have maintained a sub-optimal level of performance compared to the White Fulani (WF) cattle breed which is the most predominant in Nigeria, making up to 51% of the national cattle herd.<br> About 99% of the MC population managed under the traditional pastoral system rely predominantly on natural range resources and crop residues.
                    </p>

            <p>
                About 99% of the MC population managed under the traditional pastoral system rely predominantly on natural range resources and crop residues. <br>
                The system therefore imposes a limitation in both production and per animal productivity, as it is constrained by poor feeding and low technology input.<br>
                The lack of breed improvement through systematic selection and cross-breeding has limited the animalâ€™s productivity to its minimum genetic potential.<br>
                In line with the National Livestock Transformation Plan of the Federal Government of Nigeria, decision to scale up and expand the multiplication of the indigenous herd of MC may be effort in the right direction to amass the genetic resources of the animal thereby bridging the national meat supply gap, create wealth and enhance food security.
